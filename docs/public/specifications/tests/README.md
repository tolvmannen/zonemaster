## Background

This is the collection of **Test Case** specifications for the Zonemaster
project. All the details are in the [Master Test Plan].

* The test cases that has been elaborated as Test Case specifications have been
  defined as a list of [test requirements]. Each test falls under a specific
  category.
* The document hierarchy of the Test Case specifications could be found in the
  [Master Test Plan].

## Mapping the Test Requirements to Test Case

* Each test level has been separated into a separate directory below this
  directory.
* Under each test level directory there is a level document (README.md)
  describing the test level. Links are found below.
* The Test Cases are listed below. The mapping from Test Requirement to Test Case
  is found in the [Test requirements] document.

## Elaboration of the Test Case

Test cases are written for almost all Test Requirements. There could be the case
that a requirement can be implemented by doing more test cases than one, or
that several requirements are solved by only one test case.

## Document hierarchy

Each Test Level described in [Master Test Plan] should be linked directly to the
correct level document (the README.md in the test level directory). The level
documents are found here:

* [Address-TP]
* [Basic-TP]
* [Connectivity-TP]
* [Consistency-TP]
* [DNSSEC-TP]
* [Delegation-TP]
* [Nameserver-TP]
* [Syntax-TP]
* [Zone-TP]

## Other documents

The following documents are linked from and used by the Test Case
specifications listed in the table below:

* [DNS Query and Response Defaults]
* [Methods common to Test Case Specifications (version 1)]
* [Methods common to Test Case Specifications (version 2)]
* [Requirements and normalization of domain names in input]
* [Severity Level Definitions]

The following documents are useful documents when studying the
Test Case specifications:

* [Mapping test messages to Test Cases]
* [Implemented Test Cases]
* [Zonemaster Master Test Plan]
