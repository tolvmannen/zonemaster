# Prerequisites

Zonemaster comes with documentation for and has been tested on the operating systems
and processor architecture listed below.

## Supported processor architectures

* x86_64 / amd64

## Supported operating system versions

* [Debian] 12
* [Docker]
* [FreeBSD] 14
* [Rocky Linux] 8
* [Rocky Linux] 9
* [Ubuntu] 20.04
* [Ubuntu] 22.04
* [Ubuntu] 24.04

Only the latest long-term supported version of Debian and FreeBSD, respectively,
is supported. All long-term supported versions of Rocky Linux and Ubuntu are
supported, unless such a version has end of support before the expected next
release of Zonemaster.

Only the Docker images provided by the Zonemaster project on [Docker Hub] are
supported. Currently only Zonemaster-CLI is supported on Docker. Docker itself
can run on any of the [Docker] supported OSs (Linux, macOS and Windows).

[Rocky Linux] has replaced CentOS in Zonemaster version v2021.2 since CentOS 8
is not supported anymore and CentOS 7 is old and does not support modern OpenSSL
required by Zonemaster. Rocky Linux is also a Red Hat derivative and is available
at large cloud providers.
